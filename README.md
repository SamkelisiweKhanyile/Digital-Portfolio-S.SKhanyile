**Work Readiness Training Digital Portfolio for Samkelisiwe Khanyile**

---

  **Introduction**

Welcome to my Digital Portfolio for Work Readiness Training. This collection showcases my journey of personal and professional growth through structured evidence and insightful reflections, following the STAR technique. Each section highlights key areas of skill-building, including career guidance, skills exploration, self-awareness, CV development, and formal submissions. Through this process, I've learned to assess my strengths, recognize areas for improvement, and align myself with industry expectations in IT. I have demonstrated not only technical expertise but also strong self-awareness, strategic planning, and effective communication. This portfolio encapsulates my evolution into a dedicated, reflective, and industry-ready software developer, built on authentic experiences with well-organized and clearly explained evidence.

### STAR Reflection
**Situation:** At the beginning of my Work Readiness Training, I felt overwhelmed and uncertain about which specific path within IT I should follow. With several options available in programming, I wasn’t sure which suited my strengths and personality. 

**Task:** I was required to attend a career counselling session, where I had to honestly explore my academic background, technical interests, and career goals.  

**Action:** I actively engaged in a structured counselling session hosted by CPUT. I completed interest assessments and used a skills-matching tool. I openly discussed my confusion between UI/UX, backend, and full-stack development. I also took notes during the session and followed up with independent research on job roles using LinkedIn and Career Junction. 

**Result:** I discovered that I thrive in structured, logical tasks and enjoy working with code and data more than design. This confirmed that back-end development aligns best with my interests. The session helped me narrow my focus to Java development and APIs, and I’ve since subscribed to a Java certification newsletter and started applying to backend internships.

### STAR Reflection
**Situation:** As part of the programme, I was asked to assess and map my current skills and identify gaps related to the job market.

**Task:** I had to complete a skills inventory, reflect on feedback from past group work, and align my technical interests with market demands. 

**Action:**  I listed hard skills like Java, Python, SQL, and basic React, and soft skills like critical thinking, collaboration, and adaptability. I also rated myself and had a peer rate me. I used that feedback to assess where to improve, and I researched job ads to match skills employers are currently demanding.

**Result:** I learned that while my backend skills are strong, I need to work more on front-end frameworks and database optimization. I’ve started practicing daily coding challenges on HackerRank and joined a GitHub community to share and improve projects. This activity has helped me build a stronger, marketable skillset and focus my energy on high-demand areas.

### STAR Reflection
**Situation:** I wanted to better understand my communication and leadership style in preparation for professional teamwork.

**Task:** I was asked to complete a personality assessment and reflect on how my type might impact workplace dynamics. 

**Action:**  I analyzed how this personality influences how I handle pressure, communicate with others, and take initiative. 

**Result:** I found that I’m naturally reflective, calm under pressure, and often serve as the mediator during group challenges. I also realized that I sometimes avoid confrontation, which I now know I must work on to become a more balanced leader. Understanding this helped me articulate my working style in my CV and during mock interviews.

### STAR Reflection
**Situation:** My previous CV was outdated and lacked detail about my technical and project-based experience. 

**Task:** I needed to create a professional CV tailored to the ICT industry, showcasing both academic and personal development.

**Action:** I selected a clean, modern layout and highlighted key achievements like my Vehicle Voting System and FlexHire projects. I included skills in Java, GUI development, Firebase, and client-server communication. I also revised it multiple times based on peer and lecturer feedback. I practiced tailoring my CV to different job applications by updating the objective section. 

**Result:** My final CV now reflects a well-rounded IT candidate with real project experience. It’s been uploaded to GitHub and is ready for internship submissions. I've also received positive feedback from my Work Readiness lecturer and peers. This boosted my confidence in presenting myself professionally.
